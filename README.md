# Gardener Management System
One of my first projects ever in university, I had to experiment with SQL databases and Object-Oriented programming. 
I decided to developer a management system for gardening companies were they can store information about jobs done, tools and
staff. At the end of each month they could generate their total costs. A user interface was also developed using Eclipse were
users could interact with.

## Technologies used
Eclipse Java 

SQL

## How to run
Any Java IDE would work.
